dummy modules for [ballistica](https://github.com/efroemling/ballistica), these can be generated using `make dummymodules` while in the ballistica repo; but since some people have an issue with this I'm uploading (and updating) them here for anyone that needs them

Current ballistica version: 1.7.32

Current ballistica build: 21728
