    no longer referenced or when its Context (Activity, etc.) dies. If you
    do not want to worry about keeping a reference to your timer around,
    you should use the bascenev1.basetimer() function instead.

    firing having the same delay as the first.

    to the various parts it creates.

    def add_actions(
        self, actions: tuple, conditions: tuple | None = None
    ) -> None:
        """Add one or more actions to the material, optionally with conditions.

        ##### Conditions
        Conditions are provided as tuples which can be combined
        to form boolean logic. A single condition might look like
        `('condition_name', cond_arg)`, or a more complex nested one
        might look like `(('some_condition', cond_arg), 'or',
        ('another_condition', cond2_arg))`.

        `'and'`, `'or'`, and `'xor'` are available to chain
        together 2 conditions, as seen above.

        ##### Available Conditions
        ###### `('they_have_material', material)`
        > Does the part we're hitting have a given bascenev1.Material?

        ###### `('they_dont_have_material', material)`
        > Does the part we're hitting not have a given bascenev1.Material?

        ###### `('eval_colliding')`
        > Is `'collide'` true at this point
        in material evaluation? (see the `modify_part_collision` action)

        ###### `('eval_not_colliding')`
        > Is 'collide' false at this point
        in material evaluation? (see the `modify_part_collision` action)

        ###### `('we_are_younger_than', age)`
        > Is our part younger than `age` (in milliseconds)?

        ###### `('we_are_older_than', age)`
        > Is our part older than `age` (in milliseconds)?

        ###### `('they_are_younger_than', age)`
        > Is the part we're hitting younger than `age` (in milliseconds)?

        ###### `('they_are_older_than', age)`
        > Is the part we're hitting older than `age` (in milliseconds)?

        ###### `('they_are_same_node_as_us')`
        > Does the part we're hitting belong to the same bascenev1.Node as us?

        ###### `('they_are_different_node_than_us')`
        > Does the part we're hitting belong to a different bascenev1.Node?

        ##### Actions
        In a similar manner, actions are specified as tuples.
        Multiple actions can be specified by providing a tuple
        of tuples.

        ##### Available Actions
        ###### `('call', when, callable)`
        > Calls the provided callable;
        `when` can be either `'at_connect'` or `'at_disconnect'`.
        `'at_connect'` means to fire
        when the two parts first come in contact; `'at_disconnect'`
        means to fire once they cease being in contact.

        ###### `('message', who, when, message_obj)`
        > Sends a message object;
        `who` can be either `'our_node'` or `'their_node'`, `when` can be
        `'at_connect'` or `'at_disconnect'`, and `message_obj` is the message
        object to send.
        This has the same effect as calling the node's
        babase.Node.handlemessage() method.

        ###### `('modify_part_collision', attr, value)`
        > Changes some
        characteristic of the physical collision that will occur between
        our part and their part. This change will remain in effect as
        long as the two parts remain overlapping. This means if you have a
        part with a material that turns `'collide'` off against parts
        younger than 100ms, and it touches another part that is 50ms old,
        it will continue to not collide with that part until they separate,
        even if the 100ms threshold is passed. Options for attr/value are:
        `'physical'` (boolean value; whether a *physical* response will
        occur at all), `'friction'` (float value; how friction-y the
        physical response will be), `'collide'` (boolean value;
        whether *any* collision will occur at all, including non-physical
        stuff like callbacks), `'use_node_collide'`
        (boolean value; whether to honor modify_node_collision
        overrides for this collision), `'stiffness'` (float value,
        how springy the physical response is), `'damping'` (float
        value, how damped the physical response is), `'bounce'` (float
        value; how bouncy the physical response is).

        ###### `('modify_node_collision', attr, value)`
        > Similar to
        `modify_part_collision`, but operates at a node-level.
        collision attributes set here will remain in effect as long as
        *anything* from our part's node and their part's node overlap.
        A key use of this functionality is to prevent new nodes from
        colliding with each other if they appear overlapped;
        if `modify_part_collision` is used, only the individual
        parts that were overlapping would avoid contact, but other parts
        could still contact leaving the two nodes 'tangled up'. Using
        `modify_node_collision` ensures that the nodes must completely
        separate before they can start colliding. Currently the only attr
        available here is `'collide'` (a boolean value).

        ###### `('sound', sound, volume)`
        > Plays a bascenev1.Sound when a collision
        occurs, at a given volume, regardless of the collision speed/etc.

        ###### `('impact_sound', sound, targetImpulse, volume)`
        > Plays a sound
        when a collision occurs, based on the speed of impact.
        Provide a bascenev1.Sound, a target-impulse, and a volume.

        ###### `('skid_sound', sound, targetImpulse, volume)`
        > Plays a sound
        during a collision when parts are 'scraping' against each other.
        Provide a bascenev1.Sound, a target-impulse, and a volume.

        ###### `('roll_sound', sound, targetImpulse, volume)`
        > Plays a sound
        during a collision when parts are 'rolling' against each other.
        Provide a bascenev1.Sound, a target-impulse, and a volume.

        ##### Examples
        **Example 1:** create a material that lets us ignore
        collisions against any nodes we touch in the first
        100 ms of our existence; handy for preventing us from
        exploding outward if we spawn on top of another object:
        >>> m = bascenev1.Material()
        ... m.add_actions(
        ...     conditions=(('we_are_younger_than', 100),
        ...                 'or', ('they_are_younger_than', 100)),
        ...     actions=('modify_node_collision', 'collide', False))

        **Example 2:** send a bascenev1.DieMessage to anything we touch, but
        cause no physical response. This should cause any bascenev1.Actor to
        drop dead:
        >>> m = bascenev1.Material()
        ... m.add_actions(
        ...     actions=(('modify_part_collision', 'physical', False),
        ...              ('message', 'their_node', 'at_connect',
        ...                  bascenev1.DieMessage())))

        **Example 3:** play some sounds when we're contacting the ground:
        >>> m = bascenev1.Material()
        ... m.add_actions(
        ...     conditions=('they_have_material', shared.footing_material),
        ...     actions=(
                  ('impact_sound', bascenev1.getsound('metalHit'), 2, 5),
                  ('skid_sound', bascenev1.getsound('metalSkid'), 2, 5)))

    Scene time maps to local simulation time in bascenev1.Activity or

    in slow-motion play modes, stop when the game is paused, etc.

    > Length of time (in seconds by default) that the timer will wait
